# Event GTFS Generator
Generates a repeating GTFS spec designed for easily modeling event shuttle bus routes. Will eventually have a command 
line interface but, for now, just asks for the grammar to be entered directly into `test.py`.

Generates stubs for `stops.txt`, `shapes.txt`, and `calendar_dates.txt`.
